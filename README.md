#Infinite Scrolling Using ASP.Net MVC/WebApi

I wrote this for a blog post that I've not yet got round to writting so thought I would throw it up here in the mean time.

It's a very basic example of implementing infinite scrolling using the WebApi's OData support and Ajax calls.

It's not very tested, but seems to "Work Well On My Machine", so use at your own risk.
